## Vision

I see this repo as a tutorial, where branches will focus on specific use cases.

I will try to get to the level of [tiangolo's Full Stack FastAPI and Postgresql](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql.git), replacing PostgreSQL and Docker with Deta Base and Micros.

But there is a long way to reach this level. And in the meantime, please consider this repo as a sandbox more than a production ready solution. In other words: **branches are not designed for prod, but for learning :)**


## How to use it

You will need to create a [Deta](https://www.deta.sh) account and grab your project key. Follow the official [documentation](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/home) to install the Deta CLI and understand the basics.

Go through the descriptions of the branches in the next section, checkout the one that matches your need, and go through its README file

## Inventory/Roadmap of the branches
