# Full Stack FastAPI and Deta

Sibling project of [tiangolo's Full Stack FastAPI and Postgresql](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql.git), replacing PostgreSQL and Docker with Deta Base and Micros.

This repo is unconventional: I will create branches per use cases. One branch per step of my musing if you will.

It will be a good way for everyone (or for me at least) to learn step by step how to implement and make the most of Deta and FastAPI.
