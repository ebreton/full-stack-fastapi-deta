# Full Stack FastAPI and Deta - Base Project Generator

Sibling project of [tiangolo's Full Stack FastAPI and Postgresql](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql.git)

Replacing PostgreSQL and Docker with Deta Base and Micros.

This repo is unconventional in its intended usage: I will create branches with incremental features.

It will be a good way for everyone to learn step by step how to implement and make the most of Deta and FastAPI. At least that is my objective
