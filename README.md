# Full Stack FastAPI and Deta

None of this would have been possible without the fantastic work put into [Tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo)'s [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi). And from the [Deta team](https://github.com/deta). Thank you very much !

## Context

This repo is unconventional: I will create branches per use cases. One branch per step of my musing if you will.

I will try to get to the level of [tiangolo's Full Stack FastAPI and Postgresql](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql.git), replacing PostgreSQL and Docker with Deta Base and Micros.
